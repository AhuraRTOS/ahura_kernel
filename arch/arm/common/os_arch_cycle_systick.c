/**
 * @file os_arch_cycle_systick.c
 * @brief Cycle counter synthesized from SysTick, for cores and devices where DWT CYCCNT is not
 *        available.
 *
 * Textually included by the shared port implementations (os_arch_port_v6m.c, _v7m.c, _v8m.c), the
 * same way each variant's os_arch_port.c includes those - it is not a separate compilation unit and
 * must never be added to a build as one.
 *
 * Two ports need it for different reasons:
 *
 *   v6m   ARMv6-M has no DWT at all, so this is the only cycle counter that exists there.
 *   v7m   DWT is OPTIONAL on Cortex-M3/M4/M7 and on ARMv8-M, and even where the unit is present
 *   v8m   CYCCNT itself may not be (DWT_CTRL.NOCYCCNT), may be gated behind debug power, or may
 *         be locked. Those ports use CYCCNT when it really counts and fall back to here when it
 *         does not - see os_arch_cycle_count_get() in each.
 *
 * What it provides is a counter that advances monotonically in CPU cycles, which is exactly what
 * its callers need: os_delay_us() and os_delay_ms()'s busy-wait path measure a SHORT interval as a
 * difference between two reads. It is not absolute time. Wraps of the SysTick down-counter are only
 * observed while this function is being polled, so an interval longer than one SysTick period that
 * is not polled throughout will be undercounted; busy-waits poll continuously and are unaffected.
