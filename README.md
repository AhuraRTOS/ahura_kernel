A small, preemptive, priority-based RTOS kernel for ARM Cortex-M, covering
everything from the M0 to the M85. It is TrustZone-aware and has no mandatory
HAL or CMSIS dependency.

- **Preemptive priority scheduler.** 31 priority levels, O(1) list-based ready
  queues, and round-robin among tasks of equal priority.
- **Full sync/IPC set.** Mutexes (always with single-level priority
  inheritance), counting semaphores, queues, event groups, and lightweight
  per-task notifications, all with millisecond timeouts.
- **Software timers and a deferrable work queue.** One-shot and periodic timers
  plus a work queue in the style of Zephyr, each on its own kernel service task.
- **Optional kernel heap.** A first-fit allocator with coalescing, comparable to
  FreeRTOS `heap_4`, compiled out entirely when unused.
- **Built-in diagnostics.** Stack watermarking and CPU usage sampling, both
  opt-in and close to free at runtime.
- **TrustZone-aware.** Secure, non-secure, or disabled, selectable per build on
  ARMv8-M.
- **Every feature is a compile-time switch.** `OS_CONFIG_<FEATURE>_ENABLE`
  removes unused code, RAM, and API surface entirely, not just at runtime.
- **Self-testing.** A built-in suite exercises every enabled feature on real
  hardware with no board or HAL dependencies, and ends with a cycle-accurate
  benchmark table.
- **Broad Cortex-M coverage.** M0/M0+/M23, M3/M4/M7, and M33/M35P/M52/M55/M85
  all share just three portable port implementations.
- **Experimental:** multi-core (SMP) scheduling and tickless idle.

## Getting started

### Quick start

1. **Configure.** Copy [`os_config_template.h`](os_config_template.h) into the
   project as `os_config.h`. Any directory works, the layout does not matter.
   Every option starts at its default value.
2. **Point the kernel build at it**, before `add_subdirectory`, so the kernel
   library and the application compile against the exact same config:

   ```cmake
   set(OS_CONFIG_DIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Core/Inc)  # wherever the copy lives
   add_subdirectory(ahura_kernel)
   ```

3. **Boot the kernel** from `main()`, after clocks are configured:

   ```c
   os_init();
   os_start();   /* never returns */
   ```

   `os_init()` has already created and started a default application task, so
   there is nothing else to create just to get moving.
4. **Write the application** in `os_main()`. Copy
   [`os_main_template.c`](os_main_template.c) into the project as `os_main.c`
   and replace the body, or spawn further tasks from it with `OS_TASK_DEFINE`
   and `os_task_create`.

New to a specific feature? [`ahura_examples/kernel/`](../ahura_examples/kernel/)
has a minimal, standalone example per feature. See [Examples](#examples).

### Configuration

Projects never edit kernel files, and the kernel ships no editable configuration
of its own. The application owns the one and only config file, following the
same model as `FreeRTOSConfig.h`:

1. Copy `ahura_kernel/os_config_template.h` into the project as `os_config.h`.
   Any directory works. Every option is active at its default value, so adjust
   values in place.
2. Make that directory visible to the **kernel library build**, not just the
   application, by setting `OS_CONFIG_DIR` before
   `add_subdirectory(ahura_kernel)`:

   ```cmake
   set(OS_CONFIG_DIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Core/Inc)  # wherever the copy lives
   add_subdirectory(ahura_kernel)
   ```

   If only the application saw the file, the kernel and the application would
   compile with different `OS_CONFIG_` values and their structure sizes would
   silently disagree. The kernel CMakeLists warns when `OS_CONFIG_DIR` is unset,
   and the build stops with a clear `#error` when no `os_config.h` is found or
   when it is missing options. A missing option would otherwise read as 0 in
   `#if` and silently disable features, so keep all of them. The template lists
   exactly what is required.

`os_config.h` is the single source of configuration. All options are plain
defines, so do not additionally define `OS_CONFIG_` macros from the build system
with `target_compile_definitions`, since that would redefine them. The
`OS_CONFIG_TRUSTZONE_*` mode values are kernel-owned (`os_arch_port_common.h`)
and the config file only selects among them. `OS_TASK_PRIO_MAX` is kernel-owned
too, fixed at `31` in `ahura.h` because that is the most a 32-bit ready bitmap
can support, so it is not one of the options `os_config.h` defines.

### Integration checklist

1. Route `SysTick_Handler` to `os_tick_handler()`. `SVC_Handler` and
   `PendSV_Handler` are provided by the port, so do not define them in
   `stm32*_it.c`.
2. Call `os_init()` after clocks are configured, so the live CMSIS
   `SystemCoreClock` is already correct when the kernel reads it. See [Platform
   clock](#platform-clock).
3. Create and start any tasks the application needs before the scheduler runs.
   `os_init()` already created the default task (see [Default application
   task](#default-application-task)) unless this is a self-test build. Then call
   `os_start()`, which never returns.
4. For task stacks, use `OS_TASK_DEFINE(name, stack_bytes)`. The size is in
   bytes, rounded up to an 8-byte multiple by the macro, and must be at least
   `OS_CONFIG_MIN_STACK_SIZE`.

Helper macros: `OS_TASK_DEFINE` (name, stack and handle), `OS_TASK_CONFIG` (what
the task does), `OS_TICKS_FROM_MS`, `OS_WAIT_NOTHING`, and `OS_WAIT_FOREVER`.

A task is declared once and created once, and its name appears only in the
declaration:

```c
OS_TASK_DEFINE(worker, 512U);   /* file scope: name, stack, handle */

os_task_create(&worker, OS_TASK_CONFIG(worker_entry, NULL, OS_TASK_PRIO_3));
os_task_start(&worker);
```

`OS_TASK_DEFINE` records what the task is called and where its stack lives, and
binds both to the handle at compile time. `OS_TASK_CONFIG` carries only what the
task *does* — entry, context, priority — so there is no name to repeat and no
stack to match up. Giving one task another task's stack is not something the API
can express.

`OS_TASK_CONFIG` follows the core count. On a single-core build it takes
`(entry, context, priority)`, because there is nothing to place a task on. On a
multi-core build it takes a fourth `core_affinity` argument, required rather
than defaulted, so every task states where it may run:

```c
/* OS_CONFIG_CORE_COUNT > 1 */
os_task_create(&worker, OS_TASK_CONFIG(worker_entry, NULL, OS_TASK_PRIO_3,
                                       OS_TASK_CORE(1) | OS_TASK_CORE(2)));
```

### Default application task

Most RTOS applications create every task by hand in `main()` before calling
`os_start()`. Ahura instead gives every application one default task for free.
`os_init()` unconditionally creates and starts it (see `os_kernel.c`'s
`os_main_system_init()`), except in self-test builds, so `main()` needs nothing
beyond the usual:

```c
os_init();
os_start();
```

The task's body is `os_main()`, declared in `ahura.h` and defined by the
application. The kernel ships no stub for it, so forgetting the file is a link
error rather than a task that silently idles. It is deliberately **not** a `_cb`
function: this is where the application's own code runs, not a kernel query for
platform behavior.

Override it with its own template, separate from `os_cb_template.c`. Copy
`ahura_kernel/os_main_template.c` into the project as `os_main.c`, add it to the
**application** build (never to the kernel, where it is deliberately absent from
the CMakeLists, just like `os_cb_template.c`), and replace `os_main()`'s body
with the application's own code. That can be a plain `while (1)` loop, or it can
spawn further tasks. Two config options size the task:

```c
#define OS_CONFIG_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE  1024U  /* bytes                            */
#define OS_CONFIG_MAIN_TASK_PRIORITY    1U     /* OS_TASK_PRIO_USER_MIN..USER_MAX  */
```

There is no switch to compile the default task out. It always exists unless the
build is a self-test build. Tasks that must exist before the scheduler starts,
which is rare, still belong in `main()`, created the usual way.

When `OS_CONFIG_TEST_ENABLE` is `1`, `os_init()` does not create `tsk_main` at
all, so the self-test suite runs alone instead of racing the application's own
task. See [Self-test suite](#self-test-suite). `os_main()` itself still compiles,
so an application's `os_main.c` links unchanged either way. It is simply never
called in that build.

### Task priorities

- `0` is the idle task, owned by the kernel.
- `OS_TASK_PRIO_MAX` is reserved for the kernel service tasks `tsk_work` and
  `tsk_timer`, which `os_init()` creates automatically. They cost no
  `OS_CONFIG_MAX_USER_TASKS` slots: the kernel reserves its service tasks' slots on
  top of that number.
- `OS_TASK_PRIO_USER_MIN` through `OS_TASK_PRIO_USER_MAX` (1 to MAX-1) are user
  tasks. `os_task_create` rejects anything outside this range.

The default application task (`tsk_main`) and the self-test task (`tsk_test`)
live in the user range too, at `OS_CONFIG_MAIN_TASK_PRIORITY` and
`OS_CONFIG_TEST_PRIORITY`. Unlike `tsk_work` and `tsk_timer` they are not
priority-reserved, so pick values that fit alongside the application's own tasks.

The kernel's own service tasks — `tsk_timer`, `tsk_work` and `tsk_log` — are
also protected: `os_task_pause` and `os_task_delete` refuse them with
`OS_STATUS_BUSY`, because the timer, work and log APIs are all built on one
running and suspending it would turn every later call into a silent no-op that
still reports success. `tsk_main` and `tsk_test` are ordinary application tasks
and stay fully under the application's control. Note that the log task is *not*
identifiable by priority — it runs at `OS_CONFIG_LOG_TASK_PRIORITY`, deliberately
low — so the protection is a property of how the task was created, not of where
it sits in the priority range.

Because mutexes always do priority inheritance, a task's effective priority can
be temporarily boosted above its configured value while it holds a contended
mutex. See [Mutexes and priority
inheritance](#mutexes-and-priority-inheritance).

Tasks at the **same** priority round-robin. `OS_CONFIG_TIME_SLICE_TICKS` sets
how long one holds the CPU before its peers get a turn:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `1` (default) | Rotate on every tick. |
| `N` | Rotate every N ticks. Fewer context switches, longer uninterrupted runs. |
| `0` | No rotation: a task runs until it blocks, yields, or is preempted. |

Only equal-priority tasks are affected — a higher-priority task always preempts
immediately, whatever the quantum. A task that blocks or yields gives up the
rest of its slice, and a freshly dispatched task always starts a whole one.
Raising the quantum also makes ticks cheaper: a tick that would only have
rotated now costs a bitmap check instead of a full `PendSV` round trip.

### Scheduler lock

`os_scheduler_lock()` / `os_scheduler_unlock()` defer context switches on the
calling core **without masking interrupts**. Interrupts keep running and keep
waking tasks; those tasks simply do not get the CPU until the outermost unlock,
which then takes the switch it deferred straight away. Nesting is counted, and
`os_scheduler_is_locked()` reports the current state.

This is the right tool when what you are guarding against is another *task*:

| Data shared between | Use | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| task ↔ task | `os_scheduler_lock` | No interrupt latency at all. |
| task ↔ ISR | `os_critical_enter` (or an atomic) | Interrupts masked for the region. |
| core ↔ core | `os_critical_enter` | Masks locally, spins the other cores. |

A scheduler lock excludes **no interrupt** and **no other core** — it is per
core, and another core keeps scheduling its own tasks normally. Anything an ISR
also touches still needs a critical section.

While the lock is held the calling task cannot block, because blocking means
switching away. Every blocking primitive behaves as if it had been called with
`OS_WAIT_NOTHING`, `os_delay_ms` busy-waits instead of sleeping, and
`os_task_pause`/`os_task_delete` aimed at the *calling* task return
`OS_STATUS_BUSY`. Keep locked regions short and free of blocking calls, exactly
as with a critical section.

### Timeout semantics

Blocking APIs (`os_mutex_lock`, `os_semaphore_take`, `os_queue_send`,
`os_queue_receive`, `os_event_wait_bits`, `os_notify_wait`) take a
`timeout_ms` argument:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `OS_WAIT_NOTHING` | Try once, return `BUSY`, `EMPTY`, or `FULL` immediately. |
| `1..N` ms | Wait up to that long, then return `OS_STATUS_TIMEOUT`. |
| `OS_WAIT_FOREVER` | Wait until available. |

Nonzero timeouts are honored only from task context after `os_start`. From
interrupt context, before the scheduler starts, or while the calling core holds
a [scheduler lock](#scheduler-lock), the call degrades to a non-blocking
attempt.

Waits are exact. Every object carries its own waiter list, and queues carry two,
one for senders and one for receivers. A blocked task consumes zero CPU until
the object signals it or its timeout expires. Unlock, give, send, receive, and
set_bits all wake the **highest-priority** waiter, FIFO among equals, while
event groups wake all waiters so each one re-evaluates its bit condition. On a
timeout the tick removes the task from both the delay list and the waiter list.
Wakeups re-check the condition, so a faster third task taking the object in
between is handled by re-waiting with the remaining timeout.

### Mutexes and priority inheritance

Mutexes always do priority inheritance, the way FreeRTOS and Zephyr do it, with
no switch to opt out while still calling it a mutex. `os_mutex_lock` boosts a
lower-priority owner to the blocking waiter's effective priority for as long as
it holds the mutex, and `os_mutex_unlock` restores it. This stays correct even
when the task holds several mutexes at once, because the restore recomputes
against every mutex it still holds rather than only the one just released.

Two limitations are accepted rather than implemented:

- **Single-level only.** An owner that is itself blocked on a second mutex held
  by a third, lower-priority task does not propagate the boost through that
  chain.
- **Lazy recompute.** A boost already in effect is not eagerly repositioned
  within some other object's wait queue, nor eagerly lowered when a waiter times
  out early. Both recompute at the owner's next `os_mutex_lock` or
  `os_mutex_unlock`.

A mutex is also an ownership object, which makes it task-only: calls from an ISR
are rejected, because an ISR has no identity of its own. It is not recursive
either, so locking a mutex the caller already holds fails with `OS_STATUS_BUSY`
rather than deadlocking.

### Task notifications

A lightweight, single-value mailbox built directly into every task's own control
block, enabled by `OS_CONFIG_NOTIFY_ENABLE`. It lets you signal one
specific task without allocating a separate semaphore or queue object:

```c
os_notify_give(&some_task, 42U);         /* ISR-safe; overwrite: last write wins */
os_notify_wait(OS_WAIT_FOREVER, &value); /* called by that task about itself     */
```

`os_notify_give` latches the value and, if the target is currently blocked
in `os_notify_wait`, wakes it immediately. A task blocked for any other
reason, such as a delay or a mutex, queue, semaphore, or event wait, is left
running as normal. The value simply waits to be picked up on its next
`os_notify_wait` call, so nothing is lost. `os_notify_wait` is
task-only, like `os_mutex_lock`, because an ISR has no task identity to wait as,
and it follows the `timeout_ms` convention above.

### Queues

A queue copies fixed-size items between tasks, or from an ISR to a task. The
macro that declares it decides where its item buffer comes from, and that is the
only difference between the two kinds. Everything else, including every send and
receive call, is the same.

| | static | your own buffer | dynamic |
|---|---|---|---|
| declare | `OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_STATIC(name, type, item_count)` | `OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_BUFFER(name, array)` | `OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_DYNAMIC(name)` |
| set up | nothing to call | nothing to call | `os_queue_init_dynamic(&name, item_size, cap)` |
| tear down | `os_queue_cleanup(&name)` | `os_queue_cleanup(&name)` | `os_queue_cleanup(&name)` |
| needs | nothing | nothing | `OS_CONFIG_ALLOC_ENABLE` |

Only the dynamic kind has an init call, because only it has work that cannot
happen until run time. Neither of the other two takes an item size or a
capacity: both are read off the array, so they cannot disagree with the storage
that actually exists.

**Static, when the size is known at compile time.** `OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_STATIC`
declares the queue and its buffer together *and* initializes them, so the queue
is usable where it stands:

```c
typedef struct { uint32_t id; uint8_t payload[6]; } sample_t;

OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_STATIC(sensor_q, sample_t, 8);   /* file scope: both objects are static */

os_queue_send(&sensor_q, &sample, 10U);          /* no init call, nothing to check */
```

There is deliberately no init call to pair it with. The item size and capacity
come from the declaration itself, so they cannot disagree with the storage that
actually exists — handing a queue a capacity larger than its buffer is otherwise
easy to do and silently reads or writes past the end of it. The buffer is
declared as `sensor_q_BUFFER` and should never be named by hand.

Everything the macro leaves out of the initializer — head, tail, count, the
waiter lists — is zero-initialized under the C rules for static storage, which
is byte-for-byte the state an init call would have written. The cost is that the
queue object lands in `.data` rather than `.bss`, so its initializer image
occupies flash.

**Dynamic, when the size is only known at run time.** `OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_DYNAMIC`
declares just the object; `os_queue_init_dynamic` allocates the item buffer from
the kernel heap and initializes the queue over it:

```c
OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_DYNAMIC(rx_q);   /* the object is still yours; only the buffer is allocated */

os_status status = os_queue_init_dynamic(&rx_q, item_size, capacity);
...
os_queue_cleanup(&rx_q);         /* returns the buffer to the heap */
```

Keeping the queue object out of the allocation means its lifetime stays obvious
and a failed call leaves nothing to clean up. `os_queue_init_dynamic` returns
`OS_STATUS_NO_MEMORY` when the heap cannot satisfy the request, and
`OS_STATUS_INVALID_ARG` for a zero or overflowing geometry rather than wrapping
it into a small allocation that later sends would index past.

**Storage you lay out yourself.** For a buffer `OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_STATIC` cannot
express — a named linker section, DMA-capable RAM, a particular alignment —
declare the array yourself and bind a queue to it. It is initialized at compile
time exactly like the static kind, so there is still nothing to call:

```c
static sample_t dma_area[8] __attribute__((section(".dma_buffers")));

OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_BUFFER(rx_q, dma_area);   /* file scope, ready to use */

os_queue_send(&rx_q, &sample, 10U);
```

Item size and capacity come from the array, so there is nothing to keep in step
by hand. Passing a *pointer* to the array instead of the array itself is a
compile error rather than a silently wrong capacity — `sizeof` on a pointer
would derive nonsense and every send past the first would run off the end of the
storage.

**Teardown is the same call for every kind.** `os_queue_cleanup` empties the
queue, and what happens to the storage depends on who owns it, so code tearing
down a mixed set of queues does not need to track which kind each one is:

- A buffer from `os_queue_init_dynamic` goes back to the heap, and the geometry
  goes with it. Re-use means another `os_queue_init_dynamic`.
- A buffer from `OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_STATIC` or `OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_BUFFER` is not the
  kernel's to release, so the queue keeps its storage and is left empty and
  immediately usable — a statically defined queue needs no init call after
  cleanup either, exactly as it needed none before.

It is not compiled out with the heap, and returns `OS_STATUS_BUSY` while any
task is still blocked on the queue, because freeing underneath waiters would
leave them parked on list nodes inside memory the heap can hand out again. Drain
the queue and let the waiters time out first.

### Atomics

An operation no other task, ISR, or core can observe half-finished. Enabled with
`OS_CONFIG_ATOMIC_ENABLE`.

```c
static os_atomic_t counter = OS_ATOMIC_INIT(0);

os_atomic_inc(&counter);              /* returns the value from BEFORE the increment */
os_atomic_add(&counter, 5);
os_atomic_cas(&counter, 10, 20);      /* swap only if it still holds 10 */
os_atomic_set_bit(&flags, 3U);
```

The problem it solves: `count = count + 1` is a load, an add, and a store.
Anything that preempts between the load and the store makes both writers compute
from the same starting value, so one increment silently disappears.

**Every read-modify-write returns the value from before the operation**, not
after it. `os_atomic_inc` returning `4` means the counter now reads `5`.

Two rules worth stating outright:

- **Declare shared words as `os_atomic_t`**, not as a plain or `volatile` int
  that you cast at the call site. An ordinary read or write of the same word is
  not ordered against these calls, which is the usual way a counter that "uses
  atomics" still loses updates.
- **`os_atomic_cas` does not retry.** A `false` return may mean another writer
  won *or* that exclusive access was lost, so it does not by itself prove the
  value changed. Loop if you only care about the final state; re-read the value
  if you need to know which happened.

**Cost depends on the core**, because the whole operation set is part of the
port rather than something portable code builds out of one primitive. Each port
implements all nine operations in whichever way its instruction set allows:

| Port | Cores | How | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os_arch_port_v7m.c`, `os_arch_port_v8m.c` | Cortex-M3, M4, M7, M33, M35P, M52, M55, M85 | One `LDREX`/`STREX` retry loop per operation, each a single asm block | Lock-free; interrupts stay enabled |
| `os_arch_port_v6m.c` | Cortex-M0, M0+, M1, M23 | Each operation inside `os_critical_enter`/`os_critical_exit` | Adds the update's length to interrupt latency, and can wait on unrelated kernel work on multi-core builds |

The second row exists because ARMv6-M has no instruction that can *detect*
interference mid-update, so it has to be prevented instead. Worth knowing before
putting an atomic in an ARMv6-M interrupt-latency budget. All of them are safe
to call from tasks and from ISRs.

Writing each operation out per port, instead of sharing one implementation
behind a selector, is what keeps the emitted code to the five instructions the
sequence actually is — at `-O0` as well as `-O2`, with nothing needing to fold
away first — and keeps compiler-generated stack traffic from ever landing
between an `LDREX` and its `STREX`.

Portable code above the port only composes these: incrementing is an add of 1,
clearing a bit is an AND with its complement. So a new port implements nine
operations and gets the full API, with no behaviour able to drift between cores.

> Cortex-M23 is ARMv8-M *baseline*: it has `LDREX`/`STREX`, but it reaches
> `os_arch_port_v6m.c` for its Thumb-1-compatible context switch and so runs the
> critical-section atomics today. Correct, just not as fast as that core allows.

### Work queue

Defer a function to run later on the highest-priority kernel task. One call, and
it is ISR-safe:

```c
static void my_handler(void *data, size_t len) { /* runs on tsk_work */ }

my_payload_t payload = { ... };                                  /* an ordinary local */

os_work_submit(my_handler, &payload, sizeof(payload), 100U);     /* 0 ms = as soon as possible */
os_work_submit(my_handler, NULL, 0U, 0U);                        /* or carry no payload at all */
```

There is no work object to declare, initialize or keep alive, and **the payload
is copied, not referenced**. The kernel takes the handler and the `len` bytes at
`data` into one of its `OS_CONFIG_MAX_WORKS` slots, then releases the slot as the
handler starts and hands it the copy. So the buffer above may go out of scope the
moment `os_work_submit` returns — a submission is complete in itself.

`OS_CONFIG_WORK_PAYLOAD_SIZE` (default 32 bytes) bounds it; anything larger is
refused with `OS_STATUS_INVALID_ARG` rather than truncated. To hand over
something bigger, submit a **pointer** to it:

```c
os_work_submit(my_handler, &object_ptr, sizeof(object_ptr), 0U);
```

which keeps the fact that the target's lifetime is now yours to manage visible at
the call site, instead of being the silent default.

Two consequences of having no handle, both deliberate:

- **Each submission is its own call.** Submitting the same handler twice runs it
  twice; there is no item for the second submission to reschedule.
- **A submission cannot be cancelled or inspected.** If a handler needs to be
  able to change its mind, give it a context it re-reads when it runs.

`os_work_submit` returns `OS_STATUS_FULL` when every slot is occupied, so a burst
larger than `OS_CONFIG_MAX_WORKS` is refused rather than silently dropped.

Handlers and timer callbacks run in task context, so they may use kernel APIs,
but they execute at the highest priority. Keep them short and do not block in
them, or everything else starves.

### Kernel heap

`OS_CONFIG_ALLOC_ENABLE` (default 1) compiles in a kernel heap of
`OS_CONFIG_HEAP_SIZE` bytes (default 4096). It is a static array, so nothing is
taken from the linker heap:

```c
void  *memory = os_mem_alloc(size);   /* 8-byte aligned, NULL when exhausted   */
os_mem_free(memory);                  /* NULL/foreign/double free are ignored  */
size_t now  = os_mem_free_get();      /* current free bytes                    */
size_t low  = os_mem_watermark_get(); /* worst-case watermark since boot       */
```

The allocator is first-fit with an address-ordered free list and coalescing of
adjacent free blocks, comparable to FreeRTOS `heap_4`, so mixed-size alloc and
free patterns do not fragment permanently. Calls are protected by the kernel
critical section, which makes them usable from tasks and ISRs, although
allocating in an ISR is discouraged because the walk over the free list runs
with interrupts masked.

### Diagnostics

**Stack watermark.** With `OS_CONFIG_STACK_WATERMARK_ENABLE` (default 1), task
stacks are pattern-filled at creation and

```c
size_t min_free;
os_task_stack_watermark_get(task, &min_free);   /* NULL task = calling task */
```

reports the worst-case remaining stack in bytes since that task was created.
It is a measurement you poll, not a detector — by the time a task has actually
overrun, the damage is already done. That is what the next option is for.

**Stack overflow detection.** With `OS_CONFIG_STACK_CHECK_ENABLE` (default 1),
every switch away from a task checks two things: that its stack pointer is still
inside its own stack, and that a guard word at the bottom of that stack is
intact. The first catches a task executing outside its stack right now; the
second catches one that went too deep and came back, which nothing else would
notice. On a hit the kernel calls

```c
void os_stack_overflow_cb(const char *task_name);   /* you define it; no kernel default */
```

The kernel ships no default for it, so a build with the check enabled and no
callback is a link error rather than an overflow detector reporting to nobody —
same rule as `os_assert_failed_cb`. Copy the definition from `os_cb_template.c`.

and then parks the core, exactly as a failed `OS_ASSERT` does — there is no
attempt to continue, because memory outside the task has already been written
and there is no way to know whose. The callback runs inside PendSV with
interrupts masked, so it must not call kernel APIs; write to a UART directly or
latch the pointer for the debugger. Cost is a compare and a load per context
switch.

Worth knowing which cores need it: **ARMv8-M mainline** (M33, M35P, M52, M55,
M85) already traps this in hardware through a per-task `PSPLIM`, whatever this
option is set to. Every other supported core — M0, M0+, M23, M3, M4, M7 — has no
stack-limit register, and this software check is the only detection available
there.

**CPU usage.** With `OS_CONFIG_CPU_USAGE_ENABLE` (default 1) the tick interrupt
counts how many ticks interrupted the idle task versus anything else, and

```c
uint32_t percent = os_cpu_usage_get();   /* 0..100 since the previous call */
```

returns the load over the window since the previous call, then restarts the
window. Resolution is one tick, so sample at a period well above the tick period,
for example once per second at a 1 kHz tick. Ticks announced after a tickless
sleep count as idle. The cost is two counter updates per tick.

### Debugging

Two independent features: assertions that catch programming errors where they
happen, and logging that does not stall the caller.

#### Assertions

`OS_CONFIG_ASSERT_ENABLE` (default 1) turns on `OS_ASSERT(expr)`. A failing
check calls `os_assert_failed_cb(file, line)` so the application can print or
record the location, then parks the core with interrupts masked so a debugger
stops at the cause. That callback is **required** when assertions are enabled:
the kernel ships no stub, because a silent one would turn every assertion into
an unexplained halt. Leaving it out is a link error.

```c
void os_assert_failed_cb(const char *file, uint32_t line)
{
    /* print it, stash it in a noinit/backup register, or just break */
    __BKPT(0);
}
```

The line the kernel draws is between a **static mistake in the code** and a
**runtime outcome**. It asserts on the former: a NULL object handle, a blocking
call made from an ISR, an `os_critical_exit()` with no matching enter (which
returns `void`, so it has no other way to report at all).

It does **not** assert on anything with a documented status, even when that
status usually means someone made a mistake. `OS_STATUS_NOT_OWNER` from
`os_mutex_unlock`, `BUSY`, `FULL`, `EMPTY`, and `TIMEOUT` all depend on runtime
scheduling, and callers are entitled to attempt the operation and handle the
result. Asserting there would halt correct programs.

Assertions only **add** checks. Every API still returns exactly the same status
either way, so a build with `OS_CONFIG_ASSERT_ENABLE=0` behaves identically,
minus the halt. Use them for programming errors, never for conditions that can
legitimately occur at runtime. The expression is not evaluated at all when
assertions are compiled out, so it must be free of side effects.

#### Logging

`OS_CONFIG_LOG_ENABLE` (default 1) provides printf-style logging that returns
immediately instead of waiting on a serial port:

```c
OS_LOG_ERROR("i2c timeout on 0x%02x", addr);
OS_LOG_WARN ("battery low: %lu mV", (unsigned long)mv);
OS_LOG_INFO ("sensor = %d", value);
OS_LOG_DEBUG("state %u -> %u", from, to);
```

Each call formats the line, copies it into a ring buffer, and returns. A
low-priority kernel task (`tsk_log`) drains the buffer in the background and
hands finished bytes to the application:

```c
void os_log_output_cb(const uint8_t *data, size_t length)
{
    HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart3, (uint8_t *)data, length, HAL_MAX_DELAY);
}
```

That callback runs on `tsk_log`, never from an ISR or a critical section, so it
may block or start a DMA transfer. It is weak and discards output by default, so
logging costs nothing until a transport is provided.

Calls above `OS_CONFIG_LOG_LEVEL` expand to nothing, arguments included, so a
disabled `OS_LOG_DEBUG` costs neither code nor the evaluation of its arguments.
Logging is safe from tasks and ISRs and never blocks: when the buffer is full
the line is dropped **whole** and counted, never written in part, and the count
is reported into the log once space frees:

```text
[    1234] I sensor = 42
[    1250] W *** 17 log lines dropped ***
[    1251] I sensor = 45
```

Two costs to budget for. `tsk_log` needs its own stack (`OS_CONFIG_LOG_TASK_STACK_SIZE`,
though not an `OS_CONFIG_MAX_USER_TASKS` slot - the kernel reserves service-task slots
separately), and formatting uses libc `vsnprintf`, which pulls newlib's formatter into the link
(roughly 1 to 3 KB) for a project that does not already use `printf`. As usual,
`%f` additionally needs `-u _printf_float`. `OS_CONFIG_LOG_LINE_MAX` is the
scratch buffer `os_log_write` places on the **caller's** stack, so every task
that logs needs that much extra headroom.

## Platform support

### Supported cores

| Architecture profile | Cortex-M cores | Ahura port | TrustZone support |
|---|---|---|---|
| ARMv6-M | M0, M0+ | `v6m` | No, the Security Extension is absent. `OS_CONFIG_TRUSTZONE_DISABLED` only |
| ARMv7-M / ARMv7E-M | M3 / M4, M7 | `v7m` | No. `OS_CONFIG_TRUSTZONE_DISABLED` only |
| ARMv8-M baseline | M23 | `v6m` | Yes, optional per device. All three `OS_CONFIG_TRUSTZONE` modes |
| ARMv8-M mainline | M33, M35P | `v8m` | Yes, optional per device. All three modes |
| ARMv8.1-M | M52, M55, M85 | `v8m` | Yes, optional per device. All three modes |

A few notes on the table. M4 and M7 are ARMv7E-M with the DSP extension, but
they are port-identical to the M3 here. The M23 is baseline, running a Thumb-1
subset, which is why it shares the `v6m` port rather than the mainline one. The
Cortex-M1 (ARMv6-M, FPGA) is deliberately not supported. "Optional per device"
means the Security Extension is a silicon-vendor choice and may also be disabled
in option bytes, in which case use `OS_CONFIG_TRUSTZONE_DISABLED`.

### Application callbacks

Application hooks carry the `_cb` suffix. Most are weak, so overriding them is
optional and the kernel's default applies otherwise; a few have no default at all
because a silent one would hide the very thing the hook exists to report, and
those are link errors until the application supplies them. For a clean starting
point, copy `ahura_kernel/os_cb_template.c` into the application source tree as
`os_cb.c`, add it to the **application** build (never to the kernel, where the
template is deliberately absent from the CMakeLists), and adapt:

- `os_assert_failed_cb` reports a failed assertion. **Required** when
  `OS_CONFIG_ASSERT_ENABLE` is 1, see [Debugging](#debugging).
- `os_log_output_cb` transmits finished log bytes. Optional: the weak default
  discards them, so logging costs nothing until a transport is provided.
- `os_tickless_pre_sleep_cb` and `os_tickless_post_sleep_cb` bracket the sleep.
- `os_arch_tz_context_save_cb` and `os_arch_tz_context_restore_cb` handle
  TrustZone secure-context banking, for non-secure kernels only.
- `os_arch_core_id_get_cb` and `os_arch_core_ipi_request_cb` are multi-core SoC
  glue, along with `os_arch_spinlock_acquire_cb` and `os_arch_spinlock_release_cb`
  on ARMv6-M multi-core SoCs, where they are mandatory.

### Platform clock

Everything that needs the CPU frequency, such as the SysTick reload,
`os_delay_us` busy-waits, and tickless accounting, reads it through one arch
function:

```c
uint32_t os_arch_clock_hz_get(void);   /* current CPU clock in Hz */
```

On ARM that is simply the live CMSIS `SystemCoreClock` variable, so the function
lives in the arch layer rather than in portable core code. There is nothing to
configure and nothing to override on a normal CMSIS project: the device's
`SystemInit()` sets the variable and `SystemCoreClockUpdate()` refreshes it after
every clock-tree change, so a board that boots on an internal oscillator and
later switches to a PLL is handled with no kernel involvement.

There is deliberately **no** build-time clock constant. A constant cannot follow
a runtime clock switch, and a stale one would silently mis-program the SysTick
reload and every busy-wait delay, which is a hard class of bug to find.

Devices whose startup code does not define the CMSIS symbol simply define it
themselves, anywhere in the application:

```c
uint32_t SystemCoreClock = 120000000U;   /* keep updated if the clock tree changes */
```

That is also the hook for a platform that keeps its frequency somewhere else,
such as a HAL getter: mirror the value into this variable whenever it changes.
The kernel re-reads it on every use, so dynamic frequency scaling works as long
as the variable stays current.

### TrustZone

`OS_CONFIG_TRUSTZONE` selects which security state the kernel runs in on ARMv8-M
cores (M23, M33, M35P, M52, M55, M85). The build fails with a clear `#error` on
cores without the Security Extension, or when the compile flags do not match the
chosen mode.

- `OS_CONFIG_TRUSTZONE_DISABLED` is the default, and the kernel ignores
  TrustZone. Use it on devices without the Security Extension, or with TrustZone
  disabled in option bytes.
- `OS_CONFIG_TRUSTZONE_SECURE` runs the kernel and every task in the secure
  state. Compile the kernel and the application with `-mcmse`. The context
  switch itself needs nothing extra, because the secure `EXC_RETURN` encoding
  equals the TrustZone-less one and the PSPLIM/MSPLIM guards stay active.
- `OS_CONFIG_TRUSTZONE_NON_SECURE` runs the kernel and its tasks non-secure,
  beside separate secure firmware. Initial task frames use the non-secure
  `EXC_RETURN` (`0xFFFFFFBC`), and the context switch calls two weak callbacks,
  which the application overrides following the `_cb` convention, so the
  secure-side glue can bank per-task secure contexts such as the secure stack
  and `PSP_S`. This mirrors how FreeRTOS's ARM_CM33 secure context management
  works:

  ```c
  void os_arch_tz_context_save_cb(uint32_t task_id);     /* before the switch, outgoing task */
  void os_arch_tz_context_restore_cb(uint32_t task_id);  /* after selection, incoming task   */
  ```

  A `task_id` of 0 is the idle task, which never owns a secure context. Tasks
  that never call secure functions need no handling at all, since the weak
  defaults do nothing.

### Multi-core (experimental)

`OS_CONFIG_CORE_COUNT` (default 1, max 31) declares how many cores schedule
tasks. Every scheduling core runs its own PendSV and SVC and its own idle task,
and pulls work from the shared ready lists. **Core affinity** selects where each
task may run:

- `os_task_config_t.core_affinity` is a bitmask of allowed cores, where bit n
  means core n. `OS_TASK_CORE_ANY` (0, the default) means any core. Change it at
  runtime with `os_task_core_affinity_set(task, mask)`. A task executing on a
  core the new mask excludes is asked to reschedule, either locally or by IPI.
- When a task becomes ready, through a wake or a start, the kernel preempts
  locally if the task's affinity allows this core. Otherwise it nudges the first
  core in the mask through `os_arch_core_ipi_request_cb`, whose weak default
  does nothing, in which case that core picks the task up at its own next tick.
- Core 0 boots the kernel as usual with `os_init` and `os_start`. Each secondary
  core is booted by the SoC layer, with a vector table pointing at the kernel's
  SVC, PendSV, and SysTick handlers, then calls `os_core_start()`. That
  configures the banked SHPR, SysTick, DWT, and MSPLIM for that core and enters
  the scheduler. It never returns.
- Core 0 owns the time base. Delays, timers, work queues, and `os_tick_get`
  advance only from core 0's tick, while ticks on other cores drive that core's
  preemption and round-robin. CPU usage through `os_cpu_usage_get` samples core 0.
- The kernel service tasks are placed with `OS_CONFIG_WORK_CORE_AFFINITY` and
  `OS_CONFIG_TIMER_CORE_AFFINITY`, both core-affinity bitmasks where 0 means any
  core, so work handlers and timer callbacks run where the config says.
- Critical sections are PRIMASK plus a global kernel spinlock with per-core
  nesting. The spinlock uses `LDREX/STREX` on ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M, while ARMv6-M
  multi-core SoCs such as the RP2040 must provide `os_arch_spinlock_acquire_cb`
  and `os_arch_spinlock_release_cb` backed by hardware spinlocks. A missing
  implementation fails at link time by design.
- The SoC layer supplies `os_arch_core_id_get_cb()`, whose weak default returns
  0, since Cortex-M has no architectural core-id register.

There is one constraint worth knowing: a task currently executing on another
core cannot be paused or deleted from this one, and the call returns
`OS_STATUS_BUSY`. Suspend it from its own core first. The SMP paths compile in
the CI matrix but have not run on real multi-core silicon yet, so treat them as
experimental.

### Tickless idle (experimental)

Config options: `OS_CONFIG_TICKLESS_ENABLE` (default 0),
`OS_CONFIG_TICKLESS_MIN_IDLE` (the shortest idle worth sleeping for), and
`OS_CONFIG_MAX_SUPPRESSED_TICKS`.

The whole group compiles away with the option, like every other feature in PART
2 of `ahura.h`: with `OS_CONFIG_TICKLESS_ENABLE` at 0 the three control
functions are neither declared nor defined, so calling one is a compile error
naming it rather than a call that silently does nothing. Guard your own call
sites the same way the self-test suite does if they must build both ways.

Two application callbacks bracket the sleep window, with prototypes in
`ahura.h`. Both are **mandatory** whenever `OS_CONFIG_TICKLESS_ENABLE` is 1: the
kernel declares them and defines neither, so a missing one is a link error
naming the function rather than a hook that quietly does nothing. Write them in
the application's callback file. Callbacks the application provides carry the
`_cb` suffix by convention:

```c
void os_tickless_pre_sleep_cb(void)   { /* select sleep mode (e.g. SLEEPDEEP), gate clocks */ }
void os_tickless_post_sleep_cb(void)  { /* clear SLEEPDEEP, restore clocks */ }
```

The reason they are required rather than defaulted is the paragraph below: an
empty pre-sleep hook on a part whose HAL runs its own tick source shortens every
suppressed sleep to that source's period, which presents as tickless idle simply
not saving any power.

**What the post-sleep hook may assume.** It runs with the kernel's interrupts
still masked and **before** the sleep has been announced, so `os_tick_get()` is
still short by the entire sleep duration while it executes. Restore hardware
there; do not call anything that blocks, delays, or waits on a tick-driven
timeout, and keep it short, because its whole duration is added to interrupt
latency. The order is deliberate:

| Step | Why it is there and not later |
|---|---|
| Measure the sleep | The counter still holds it, and the normal tick cadence is restored |
| `os_tickless_post_sleep_cb` | Hardware must be back before any kernel work depends on it |
| `os_tick_announce` | Catches up `os_tick_count`, timers, work and task delays in one go |
| Release the interrupt mask | Only now is the kernel's view of time consistent |

Announcing after the mask is released would let a tick or timer run against a
clock hundreds of ticks behind reality; announcing before the hardware is
restored would let the context switch `os_tick_announce` can pend be taken
immediately, leaving the idle task, and the restore, stranded.

**Suspend every other periodic interrupt source here too, not just SysTick.**
WFI wakes on any pending interrupt regardless of masking, so anything else
firing more often than the planned sleep will cut every suppressed sleep short
at its own period, no matter how long SysTick itself was reprogrammed for. A
common example is a HAL library's own tick redirected to a spare timer,
precisely so the RTOS can have SysTick to itself. On STM32, `HAL_SuspendTick()`
and `HAL_ResumeTick()` are the standard hook for this. A periodic ADC or comms
timer has the same effect. `os_tickless_pre_sleep_cb` and
`os_tickless_post_sleep_cb` are exactly where to pause and resume those sources.

**Status.** `os_tickless_expected_idle_ticks_get()` already bounds the planned
sleep by the earliest of the next software-timer expiry, the next ready work
item, and the next finite-delay task sleeper, so `os_delay_ms` waiters are
covered and not just timers.

On the ARMv8-M mainline port (`os_arch_port_v8m.c`, covering the M33, M35P, M52,
M55, and M85), `os_arch_sleep_prepare` and `os_arch_elapsed_ticks_get` now
really suppress SysTick for the sleep window. They reprogram its reload one tick
short of the plan, so the real final tick still fires normally and supplies the
last tick's accounting through the ordinary `os_tick_handler` path. This is the
same technique FreeRTOS's tickless idle uses. They also measure the real elapsed
time from SysTick itself rather than the DWT cycle counter, which is not
reliable across an actual sleep on most implementations.

Remaining work:

- The ARMv6-M and ARMv7-M/E-M ports (`os_arch_port_v6m.c`,
  `os_arch_port_v7m.c`) still need the identical fix. Same register layout, not
  yet ported over.
- The idle task still runs a plain `WFI` loop and does not yet call
  `os_tickless_idle_process()`. That function is exposed in `ahura.h` and
  exercised directly by the self-test suite through `test_tickless_sleep()`,
  ahead of the wiring landing.
- A deeper-sleep path, such as STOP mode where SysTick itself stops, would need
  an always-running wake and measurement source instead.
  `OS_CONFIG_LPTIM_CLOCK_HZ` is reserved for that but unused so far.

---

## Testing and examples

### Self-test suite

The suite is not copied into the application. It is a normal buildable module
with its own `CMakeLists.txt` (`ahura_kernel/test/CMakeLists.txt`), producing a
static library `os_test` that links against `ahura_kernel` and supplies
`os_test()`. Any project that already builds the kernel can add it:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(ahura_kernel)
add_subdirectory(ahura_kernel/test)   # builds the os_test library

target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE
    ahura_kernel
    os_test
)
```

That is an ordinary static-library link, with no `--whole-archive` needed. The
kernel deliberately ships no stub for `os_test()`, so `os_kernel.c.o` leaves the
symbol undefined and the linker has a reason to extract `os_test.c.o` from the
archive. Forgetting the library is a link error rather than a test suite that
silently vanishes from the build.

Once linked, `os_init()` creates and starts the self-test task by itself, gated
by `OS_CONFIG_TEST_ENABLE`, which is off by default in the template so each
project opts in. There is nothing to call:

```c
os_init();   /* creates and starts tsk_test too, since os_test is linked and TEST_ENABLE=1 */
os_start();
```

`tsk_main` is **not** created alongside `tsk_test`, so the suite runs alone
rather than letting the application's own task race it for CPU time and
task-table slots. Set `OS_CONFIG_TEST_ENABLE` back to `0` to get `tsk_main`
running normally again.

The task runs `os_test()` once. It exercises whichever
`OS_CONFIG_<FEATURE>_ENABLE` switches are on, covering tasks, delays, critical
sections, the scheduler lock, mutexes and priority inheritance, semaphores,
queues, event groups, task notifications, timers, work items, the kernel heap,
stack watermarks, CPU usage, and the intrusive list. It prints a detailed PASS/FAIL log via `printf`
with a pass/fail summary, then finishes with a **benchmark table**: each hot
kernel path timed with the CPU cycle counter, sampled repeatedly with the
minimum kept, and the measurement overhead subtracted. The header reports the
core profile, optimization level, and clocks, so a result is always
interpretable.

The suite depends on nothing but `ahura.h`, with no board or HAL headers, so it
runs on real hardware for any arch or board the kernel supports. Retarget
`printf`'s destination, typically a UART, in the application to see the log.

#### Stress tests

Beyond the functional checks, the suite runs three tiers of stress, each aimed at
a different class of bug:

| Tier | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Multi-primitive soak** | `test_stress_soak` — 4 tasks at distinct priorities hit a mutex, an under-provisioned semaphore and queue, an event group and the heap *simultaneously* for many iterations, then check hard invariants (exact mutex-protected counter, exact token reconciliation, no leak, no corruption) |
| **Create/destroy churn** | `test_stress_task_churn`, `test_stress_timer_churn` — one create/run/exit or init/start/stop path cycled 500 times, to shake out slot-reuse and list-corruption bugs |
| **Per-subsystem stress** | Nine tests, one subsystem each, at high volume with exact accounting (below) |

The per-subsystem tier:

| Test | Invariant it enforces |
|---|---|
| `test_stress_queue_dynamic_churn` | 200 `os_queue_init_dynamic`/use/`os_queue_cleanup` cycles, geometry varying each time, leak nothing and corrupt no payload |
| `test_stress_queue_dynamic_concurrent` | 3 producers × 32 items through a heap-allocated queue of capacity 2; every `(producer, sequence)` pair arrives exactly once — a lost send-waiter wakeup is a missing bit, a double delivery an already-set one |
| `test_stress_heap_fragmentation` | Freeing a block never disturbs a live neighbour; adjacent holes really coalesce; the heap recovers byte-exactly after being driven to exhaustion |
| `test_stress_semaphore_pingpong` | 1000 round trips (2000 blocking handoffs) through two empty binary semaphores, so every take blocks and every give wakes a waiter — no token is ever already available to mask a lost wakeup |
| `test_stress_notify_storm` | 1000 notifications to a higher-priority waiter that consumes each before the next is written, so exact 1:1 accounting is meaningful for a last-write-wins mailbox |
| `test_stress_event_bit_storm` | 4 tasks × 250 iterations of set/wait/clear-on-exit on their own bit of one group; all bits must end clear |
| `test_stress_work_flood` | Registry oversubscribed 2:1, half the accepted items cancelled; executed + cancelled + refused must reconcile exactly, then 20 more churn rounds |
| `test_stress_timer_flood` | Every timer slot armed periodically at once, each at its own period; one past capacity refused with `FULL`; a stopped timer never fires again |
| `test_stress_mutex_convoy` | 4 tasks × 200 acquisitions on one mutex, yielding *inside* the section — exclusivity checked from within, exact total from without, and no task starved |

Every count is exact rather than approximate, deliberately: a check that only
asserts "roughly the right number of things happened" cannot tell a dropped
wakeup from scheduling jitter, so it has to be written loose enough to pass
through the very bug it exists to catch. The one exception is timer fire counts
over a wall-clock window, where the tolerance is bounded at ±2 rather than left
open.

The per-subsystem tier costs about 15 KB of flash, most of it the `.rodata` for
its PASS/FAIL messages. It is therefore compiled in whenever the build is
optimized at all (`__OPTIMIZE__`, i.e. any `-O` above `-O0`) and skipped
otherwise, with a run-time `[SKIP]` line naming the reason. That key is the
optimization level rather than a hand-set switch because that is what actually
decides whether it fits — an unoptimized build of a 128 KB part may well have no
room — and because stress timings at `-O0` say little about shipped firmware
anyway. Define `OS_TEST_STRESS_EXTENDED` to override in either direction.

### Examples

[`ahura_examples/kernel/`](../ahura_examples/kernel/) has one small, focused
example per kernel feature, each meant to be copied over `os_main.c`. Same rule
as the self-test suite: they depend on nothing but `ahura.h`, with no board or
HAL headers.

| Example | Demonstrates |
|---|---|
| `os_main_hello.c` | The minimal application: `os_main()`, `os_delay_ms`, `printf` |
| `os_main_task.c` | Task lifecycle: create, start, pause, resume, delete |
| `os_main_delay.c` | `os_delay_ms`, `os_delay_us`, `os_delay_s` |
| `os_main_critical.c` | Critical sections protecting a shared counter |
| `os_main_mutex.c` | Mutual exclusion with `os_mutex_*` |
| `os_main_semaphore.c` | Counting semaphore, producer and consumer |
| `os_main_queue.c` | Message queue, producer and consumer, both static (`OS_QUEUE_DEFINE_STATIC`) and dynamic (`os_queue_init_dynamic`) storage |
| `os_main_event.c` | Event group, waiting on multiple bits |
| `os_main_notify.c` | Task notifications with `os_notify_*` |
| `os_main_timer.c` | One-shot and periodic software timers |
| `os_main_work.c` | Deferrable work queue |
| `os_main_mem.c` | Kernel heap with `os_mem_alloc` and `os_mem_free` |
| `os_main_stack_watermark.c` | Worst-case stack headroom |
| `os_main_cpu_usage.c` | CPU load sampling |
| `os_main_log.c` | Buffered debug logging (`OS_LOG_*`) |
| `os_main_atomic.c` | Atomic counters and flags with `os_atomic_*` |
| `os_main_list.c` | The intrusive list utility |

Each file needs its matching `OS_CONFIG_<FEATURE>_ENABLE` on, and a compile-time
`#error` says so if it is not. Each one is a complete, standalone `os_main()`,
so copy any of them over the project's `os_main.c` to see it run.

## Internals

### Source layout

#### Top-level files

- `ahura.h` is the public umbrella API, and the only header applications
  include. It reads in two parts: **PART 1** is everything no option can remove
  (types, tasks, time, critical sections, the intrusive list), so anything found
  there can be used unconditionally; **PART 2** is one group per `OS_CONFIG_`
  option, each behind a single guard covering its types, macros and functions
  together, in the same order as `os_config.h`. It declares `os_main()` and
  `os_test()` as well, even though the kernel defines neither: supplying them is
  the application's job through its `os_main.c`, or the test library's. Neither
  carries the `_cb` suffix used elsewhere in this header. That suffix is
  reserved for callbacks the kernel queries for platform behavior, such as
  `os_tickless_pre_sleep_cb`, whereas `os_main()` and `os_test()` are where the
  application's or suite's own code runs.
- `os_config_template.h` is the template for the application's `os_config.h`. It
  lists every build-time option at its default value: tick rate, task and timer
  limits, stack sizes, heap size, TrustZone mode, core count, and the per-feature
  `OS_CONFIG_<FEATURE>_ENABLE` switches for mutex (always with single-level
  priority inheritance, like FreeRTOS and Zephyr), semaphore, queue, event,
  timer, work, task notifications, alloc, stack watermark, CPU usage, the
  default application task, and the self-test task. The intrusive list module
  has no switch, since the scheduler runs on it. This file is never included by
  the kernel, so copy it into the project. See
  [Configuration](#configuration). Disabling a feature compiles out its code and
  API, and disabling timer, work, the default task, or the self-test task also
  removes the corresponding kernel service task and its stack.

  It reads in three parts, most important first: **PART 1** the core options
  that always apply (tick rate, task table, default task, interrupt mask);
  **PART 2** one section per optional feature, each holding its `_ENABLE` switch
  next to the sizing that switch controls, so turning a feature off shows
  exactly which values stop mattering — `OS_CONFIG_MAX_TIMERS` and
  `OS_CONFIG_TIMER_STACK_SIZE` sit under the timer switch, the log sizing under
  `OS_CONFIG_LOG_ENABLE`, and so on; **PART 3** the platform properties
  (TrustZone, core count, tickless). The option *set* is fixed regardless — the
  kernel still rejects an `os_config.h` that is missing any of them.
- `os_cb_template.c` is the template for the application-side callbacks, and is
  deliberately not compiled into the kernel. See [Application
  callbacks](#application-callbacks).
- `os_main_template.c` is the template for the default application task's body,
  also deliberately not compiled into the kernel. See [Default application
  task](#default-application-task).
- `test/` holds the kernel self-test suite (`os_test.c`), its own buildable
  module with the target `os_test` and its own `CMakeLists.txt`. See [Self-test
  suite](#self-test-suite).

#### `core/` portable kernel modules

All filenames are `os_`-prefixed:

- `os_kernel.c` covers the lifecycle (`os_init`, `os_start`, the running flag),
  the default application task (`os_main`, see
  [Default application task](#default-application-task)), and the self-test task
  (`os_test`, see [Self-test suite](#self-test-suite)).
- `os_mem.c` is the kernel heap (`os_mem_alloc` and `os_mem_free`), a first-fit
  allocator with coalescing over a static `OS_CONFIG_HEAP_SIZE` heap.
- `os_task.c` holds the static TCB pool and O(1) list-based scheduling: one FIFO
  ready list per priority plus a ready bitmap, where the highest set bit is the
  next priority to run and costs a single `CLZ` on ARMv7-M and up, round-robin
  by list rotation, and a delay list holding only the finite-delay sleepers.
  This is also where the scheduler lock and mutex priority inheritance's
  effective-priority changes live, since both are entirely about the TCB and the
  ready lists rather than about separate kernel objects.
- `os_notify.c` is direct-to-task notifications (`os_notify_give`,
  `os_notify_wait`). The one-word mailbox itself sits in the TCB, because it
  belongs to the task rather than to any object, so `os_task.c` hands out the
  slot and this module owns everything about what a notification means.
- `os_tick.c` is the tick counter and tick handler, which wakes delays, drives
  timers, and preempts.
- `os_delay.c` provides blocking millisecond and second delays plus a
  DWT-precise microsecond busy-wait.
- `os_critical.c` implements PRIMASK-based nesting critical sections.
- `os_mutex.c`, `os_semaphore.c`, `os_queue.c`, and `os_event.c` are the sync
  and IPC primitives with `timeout_ms` waits.
- `os_timer.c` holds the software timers. Expiry is detected by the tick and
  callbacks run on the kernel timer task `tsk_timer` at the highest priority.
- `os_work.c` is the deferrable work queue in the style of Zephyr. Items run on
  the kernel work task `tsk_work`, also at the highest priority.
- `os_list.c` is the intrusive doubly-linked list. It is always compiled, since
  the scheduler itself runs on it and it cannot be configured out, and it is
  also public API.
- `os_internal.h` is the internal cross-module contract, not for applications.

#### `arch/arm/` port layer

This layer covers the SysTick tick source, SVC first-task start, PendSV context
switch, initial stack frames, and the cycle counter. Shared code is organized by
architecture, the same split Zephyr and CMSIS-RTX use: one v6m implementation,
one v7m implementation, one v8m implementation, with thin per-core wrapper
folders on top.

- `common/os_arch_port_v7m.c` is the ARMv7-M (M3) and ARMv7E-M (M4, M7)
  implementation. It is Thumb-2 and FPU-aware, saving `s16-s31` and a per-task
  `EXC_RETURN` when built with a hard or softfp float ABI.
- `common/os_arch_port_v8m.c` is the ARMv8-M mainline (M33, M35P) and ARMv8.1-M
  (M52, M55, M85) implementation. It is a superset of the v7m port that always
  saves and restores `PSPLIM` per task and programs `MSPLIM` for the handler
  stack when the linker script provides the stack-bottom symbol, so a stack
  overflow raises a UsageFault instead of silently corrupting memory. TrustZone,
  in all three `OS_CONFIG_TRUSTZONE` modes, lives here.
- `common/os_arch_port_v6m.c` is the ARMv6-M (M0, M0+) and ARMv8-M baseline
  (M23) implementation. It uses the Thumb-1 subset and has no FPU, and the cycle
  counter is synthesized from SysTick because these cores have no DWT CYCCNT.
  Baseline does not belong in the v8m file because it cannot execute the
  mainline Thumb-2 ISA, so its TrustZone support is handled here. Non-secure
  v8-M baseline has no `PSPLIM`, so there is no stack-limit handling.
- Each shared file carries a `#error` guard against being compiled for the wrong
  architecture profile.
- `cortex_m0/`, `cortex_m0plus/`, and `cortex_m23/` are thin wrappers over the
  v6m port.
- `cortex_m3/`, `cortex_m4/`, and `cortex_m7/` are thin wrappers over the v7m
  port. The M7 additionally relies on the DWT LAR unlock done in `os_arch_init`.
- `cortex_m33/`, `cortex_m35p/`, `cortex_m52/`, `cortex_m55/`, and
  `cortex_m85/` are thin wrappers over the v8m port. On the v8.1-M cores,
  Helium/MVE state is covered by the existing s16-s31 save plus hardware lazy
  stacking of s0-s15, FPSCR, and VPR. The folder names follow GCC's `-mcpu`
  spelling, so it is `cortex_m0plus` because the core is the M0"plus", but
  `cortex_m35p` because that core's "P" means physical security rather than plus
  (`-mcpu=cortex-m35p`).
- The build selects the variant from `-mcpu`, falling back to `-march`, so
  `armv8.1-m.main` maps to `cortex_m55` and so on. All folders of one profile
  include the same shared port, so any core of the right architecture is
  equivalent. See `ahura_kernel/CMakeLists.txt`. Override the choice with
  `-DOS_ARCH_VARIANT=cortex_m4`. Note that GCC learned `-mcpu=cortex-m52` in GCC
  14, so older toolchains build that core with `-march=armv8.1-m.main+mve.fp`,
  which the fallback resolves automatically.
- The `MSPLIM` guard is active when the linker script provides the bottom of the
  main stack as `__StackLimit`, used by CMSIS-style scripts, or `_sstack`, used
  by several vendor-generated ones. Both are weak references, so either naming
  works unmodified, and when neither symbol exists the guard is skipped.
- TrustZone, the ARMv8-M Security Extension, is selected with
  `OS_CONFIG_TRUSTZONE`. See [TrustZone](#trustzone).
- Not covered yet: PAC/BTI (`-mbranch-protection` on the M85).

## Notes and constraints

- Do not block, whether by delaying or locking with a timeout, inside a critical
  section, a scheduler-locked region, or an ISR. Under a scheduler lock the
  kernel enforces it: blocking calls degrade to non-blocking rather than parking
  a task it cannot switch away from. See [Scheduler lock](#scheduler-lock).
- The kernel's service tasks (`tsk_timer`, `tsk_work`, `tsk_log`) cannot be
  paused or deleted by the application; both calls return `OS_STATUS_BUSY`.
- Work handlers and timer callbacks run on the highest-priority kernel tasks, so
  keep them short and non-blocking or user tasks will starve.
- Timers run in two modes, `OS_TIMER_MODE_ONE_SHOT` which fires once then stops,
  and `OS_TIMER_MODE_PERIODIC` which reloads every period. Select the mode in
  `os_timer_init`.
- Mutexes are task-only and non-recursive. See [Mutexes and priority
  inheritance](#mutexes-and-priority-inheritance).
- The project builds with the hard-float ABI, and the port saves and restores
  the FPU context (`s16-s31` plus a per-task `EXC_RETURN`) automatically.
